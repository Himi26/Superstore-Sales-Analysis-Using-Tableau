# Superstore Sales Analysis Using Tableau
## ðŸ“„ About
The Superstore-Sales dataset provides detailed information on a company's sales. An exploratory analysis was conducted on the Super Store discount data. As part of this analysis, data visualizations were created to identify the three worst-performing sub-categories in each region and quantify their performance compared to other sub-categories. The purpose of these visualizations is to guide decisions on which product categories to eliminate and in which regions.

Furthermore, a deeper analysis was performed to examine the relationship between discounted sales and profit. This analysis determines the extent to which the company is profiting or experiencing losses based on discounted sales.

Additionally, the analysis assesses potential opportunities for improving efficiency in discount handling. It investigates whether certain customers receive more discounts than others and whether specific product categories or segments receive disproportionately higher discounts compared to others.
